## Deep Learning for MEG Data Classification

#### Overview
This GitHub repository contains the materials used in the group project for the Pattern Recognition and Deep Learning course at Utrecht University. The repository includes a detailed report and a collection of scripts used to train, test, and visualize deep learning models applied to Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data.

#### Abstract
This project investigates the use of deep learning architectures, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to enhance the interpretability and classification of MEG data. MEG is a neuroimaging technique that captures brain wave activity with high temporal resolution. However, the complexity of the data presents significant challenges in analysis and interpretation. The project explores two types of classification: Intra-Subject, where the model is trained and tested on the same subject, and Cross-Subject, where the model is trained on one set of subjects and tested on unseen subjects. The classification task involves categorizing brain states into rest, story, memory, or motor activities. The results provide insights into the optimal CNN architectures for MEG data classification, offering potential improvements in understanding brain function through enhanced data analysis.
